  		<h3>Who Am I</h3>
  		<p>I am a girl in mid-teenage. From childhood, I always loved to interact with people. I like to know people and make friends. I am a social person and go out with my friends and family. Also, I like to visit new places. Nature attracts me. Therefore, whenever I get the vacation I always insist on my friends and family for a getaway in nature’s lap.</p>

		</a>
		
		<p>Travelling gives me immense pleasure. I always capture beautiful moments and places in my camera. Whenever I am sad, I revisit my photo album to look at the beautiful places and moments. The thought of those happy moments and beautiful places makes me happy. I am serious and disciplined about my studies and read many books other than my textbooks. Reading detective storybooks are what I like. I am involved in extra curriculum activities. I am learning music too.
		</p>

		<p>Every person is a mix of good and bad qualities. I am not an early riser by nature. I understand that waking up early is very important to become productive. Still, during my holidays I take the liberty of waking up late. I am an ambitious person and a dreamer. My dream is to become a programmer. Click link below if you want to know why.

  		<h3>What I Do</h3>
  		<p>Here are my habits as a student that you can use as tips to do better in school:</p>

  		<table border=1 style="width:100%; text-align: center; color: black; background-color: #FDFD96;">
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td>I Google EVERYTHING</td>
					<td>It’s like an automatic reaction. New concept = go to Google for a quick explanation. I don’t think just because my professor gives me a textbook and some examples on the whiteboard that I'm limited to that information. I have a massive free search engine at my fingertips, so I make use of it.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>I study in short bursts, not long marathons.</td>					
					<td>Studying in short bursts tends to help me focus intensely because I know there is at least a short break coming.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr style="">
					<td>I sleep-a lot</td>
					<td>The daily routines of me are characterized by periods of intense work (5 hours per day) followed by significannt quantities of high-quality sleep (8 hours per night). The idea is to alternate periods of intense work with rest, so that I create tons of new connections in my nervous system and then allow adequate time to assimilate those gains.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>I make the best out of lecture</td>
					<td><p>Yes, lectures are boring. Yes, sometimes it's too fast that I can’t keep up and miss all the important stuff and sometimes it's too slow that I start zoning out because I already understand everything.</p>

					<p>So what’s the best use of my time while I’m in the classroom? I ask questions, bring the textbook and look stuff up, focus on the important practice problems to copy down in my notes, try to anticipate what the professor is going to say, make note of anything they put emphasis on as a potential exam topic. All of these things make the time I have to spend in lecture more productive and engaging. And that’s less time I have to spend studying later on.</p></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>I'm busy with work and side projects</td>
					<td><p>Yes, to do well in a course, I need to focus and put in the hours. Involvement in a diverse set of subjects, activities and skill sets keeps me active and provides me with a rich and diverse set of mental models to pull from.</p>

					<p>Also, when I stay active in multiple areas, I don’t have time to procrastinate and am forced to be efficient with my study time. This generally translates into quicker learning and better performance throughout the semester.</p></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>I don't wait for motivation to strike</td>
					<td>Motivation comes and goes, but studying for a degree requires persistence and consistency. I figure out how to get my coursework done when it’s the last thing I want to do.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>I make my own study guides</td>
					<td><p>I don’t simply use the study guide the teacher provides, I create my own too.</p>

					<p>Creating the study guide is half the battle, requiring me to go through my notes, consolidate them and organize them in a way that I understand–all valuable study activities.</p></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>I use the 80/20 rule</td>
					<td><p>Yes, I do every reading assignment, finish every practice problem and attend every study session I can get my hands on. But these students are missing the point. There will always be an endless amount of information I could learn given the time and effort, but having the ability to discern what is worth learning will truly set me apart.</p>

					<p>I identify the 20% of concepts I need to learn deeply, in order to determine 80% of my final grade. I focus intently on those few things and simply ignore the rest. This is a formula for high performance, without hours and hours of busywork. And it translates seamlessly into the real world too.</p></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>I take personal responsibility for learning the material</td>
					<td>I understand that I and only I am truly responsible for my own education. So waiting to be spoon-fed by my professor and doing the homework assignments will never be enough. Despite my school’s best intentions, I’ll never be as committed to my academic success as I can be.</td>
				</tr>

 	 	<h3>Reflection on Myself</h3>
 	 	<p>	My belief about myself as a learner when I entered the class was a positive one. I went to an university last year. I had plenty of practice with different learning techniques and found what works well for me. I believe I’m more of a visual learner than an auditory learner. It is easier to see a PowerPoint and retain the knowledge then listen to a lecture and have the same retention. Entering the class, I thought I liked working in groups more than working individually on projects, but that has since changed. I think it is more beneficial to me to work alone because I can get more done. When I entered the class, I believed that reading the material closer to the due date was a better idea because I may not remember what I had read if I didn’t.</p>

 	 	<p>What I have discovered about myself, as a learner over the term is vast. I learned that I can read the material way in advance and just briefly skim over the text and remember just about everything, were as I thought reading closer was more beneficial. I also learned that working in groups really isn’t my specialty. I prefer working by myself because I’m able to get a lot more done and not have to worry about other people forgetting their part of the project. I don’t like having to worry about other people no following through. I also learned that looking at the daily record in advanced helped me in planning how to divide up my assignment load. I also learned that I really don’t like speaking in front of people, it is very terrifying. On that note, I also learned that I really don’t like debating. I never knew that debating was so nerve racking. I also like having a mentor session to work over any problems that I might not have been able to get answered in class or didn’t even ask in the first place. I also learned that having a class with people who don’t judge or make fun of your questions making the learning process a lot easier than it would be if people were judgmental.</p>

 	 	<p>I learned from my first project that working in groups wasn’t my favorite task in the world. My group encountered so many problems and had people not show up for meetings that it was almost impossible to get anything done. From the readings I learned that highlighting and taking notes helps a lot when I reader farther out but reading sooner doesn’t require a lot of note taking at all. I learned that mapping out my ideas for my paper, in the form of an outline was very helpful in organizing a stronger paper.</p>

 	 	<p>From the debates held in class, I learned how to make a statement work for my side of the argument and how to argue it well. I learned that using more than one source for information is better because not only does it paint a larger picture, it gives me facts or ideas I might have overlooked otherwise. Through the class I have also learned taking notes while the lecture is in process makes it easier to understand the assignments later and have a better resource then just sitting there listening.</p>

 	 	<p>With the computer lab, project and debates, I learned communication skills that surpass the ones I brought into the class in the beginning. I learned how to organize my time more efficiently when doing the assignments. From the readings and handouts, I learned how to read critically and understand the information more thoroughly then just blankly reading the paper. From the discussion groups during class, I have learned to be more open to sharing my opinions rather than keeping them to myself.</p>

 	 	<p>I worked hard this term, pushing myself to finish all my assignments and to try them in ways I have never done before. What also helped me learn a great deal with term were the actual students in my class.  In other classes I have a more difficult time sharing my opinions because people tend to be very judgmental of what other people say. The class I was fortunate enough to be in did wonders for me. When I had a question about an assignment or during a lecture, I was never afraid to voice my thoughts or concerns because no one would judge me if I had a question.</p>
